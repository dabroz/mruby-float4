# mruby-float4 ![travis status](https://travis-ci.org/dabroz/mruby-float4.svg)

Small vector classes for mruby. Primarily for game developers. Provides a set of functions similar to shading languages (GLSL/HLSL/Cg).

## Installation

Add
```ruby
  conf.gem github: 'dabroz/mruby-float4'
```

to your `build_config.rb`.

## Usage

There are two ways to use this library. First is the "Ruby" way - operate on vector instances like they were regular classes:

```ruby
a = Vec4.new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)
b = Vec4.new(2.0 ,4.0, 5.0, 6.0)
c = (a * 2.0 + b).normalize.dot(Vec4.new(0, 0, 1, 1))
```

Another is a typical shading language syntax, using an optional module import:

```ruby
extend Vec4::GLSL
a = vec4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)
b = vec4(2.0 ,4.0, 5.0, 6.0)
c = dot(normalize(a * 2.0 + b), vec4(0, 0, 1, 1))
```

All vector instances are immutable (there is no `x=` and similar functions). This is done intentionally. Since Ruby has no "by value" structures it is very for someone used to shading languages to **not** create a duplicate of vector and modify multiple instances incorrectly. 

### Available types

 - `Vec4` (4x `float`), `Vec3` (3x `float`), `Vec2` (2x `float`)
 - `IVec4` (4x `mrb_int`), `IVec3` (3x `mrb_int`), `IVec2` (2x `mrb_int`)
 - `BVec4` (4x `mrb_bool`), `BVec3` (3x `mrb_bool`), `BVec2` (2x `mrb_bool`)

### Supported functions

- `+`
- `-`
- `*`
- `/`
- `-@`
- `acos`
- `asin`
- `atan2`
- `atan`
- `ceil`
- `clamp` 
- `cos`
- `cross`
- `degrees`
- `dot`
- `exp2`
- `floor`
- `fract`
- `inversesqrt`
- `length_squared`
- `length`
- `lerp`
- `log2`
- `log`
- `max`
- `min`
- `mix` 
- `normalize`
- `radians`
- `reflect`
- `refract`
- `saturate`
- `sin`
- `smoothstep`
- `sqrt`
- `step`
- `tan`
- all possible swizzle combinations (`.xyz`, `.xyz`, `.xxx` etc)

Helper functions:

- `data_size` (`4` for `Vec4`)
- `data_class` (`Float` for `Vec4`)

## Design

It is written completly in C (although C code is autogenerated from Ruby template) for performace reasons. C functions do not usually call Ruby, so things like overridden `Math.floor` won't change this gem behavior.

Data is stored withing the object as simple C structure (for size and performance), which has several side-effects:
- any overrides on `Float` won't change this gem behavior
- `VecX` family uses single-precision float numbers (mruby uses double-precision by default)

## Known limitations

- `2.0 * Vec2.new(1.0, 2.0)` won't work, because mruby doesn't currently support Fixnum/Float operators overloading. There is however a [pull request for that](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/2579) in the works.

## Performance

```
benchmark/bm_ao_render.rb        (pure Ruby)     [256x256] -> 1m40.712s
benchmark/bm_ao_render_float4.rb (with this gem) [256x256] -> 0m59.265s
```

So there is a slight performance bonus of using this gem. There is some room for improvement, including using [inline structures](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/issues/3237) in mruby.
